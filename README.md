# Motivation
he motivation behind the development of ocean pol- lution detection through image processing is grounded in a profound concern for environmental well-being. As marine ecosystems face escalating threats, the impera- tive to monitor and manage ocean pollution becomes increasingly evident. Pollution adversely impacts aquatic life, disrupts ecosystems, and jeopardizes biodiversity, necessitating a proactive approach to identify and mitigate pollution sources for sustainable environmental conservation. The detection of ocean pollution is not only a matter of ecological significance but also holds implications for human health. Contaminated water poses risks through the consumption of polluted seafood and the compromise of drinking water quality.
In essence, the motivation for ocean pollution detection using image processing is rooted in the multifaceted pur- suit of environmental preservation, human health protec- tion, economic sustainability, global awareness, and the leveraging of cutting-edge technologies for a resilient and sustainable future.
